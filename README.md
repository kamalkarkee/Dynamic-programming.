# Dynamic-programming.
Understanding of subset sums.

Design, code, and test a C program that uses dynamic programming to partition (if possible) a
sequence of n positive integers into three subsequences such that the sum of each subsequence is the
same. For example, if the input were (10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50, 80), with a total of m = 270, the three
m/3 = 90 subsequences could be (10, 80), (20, 30, 40), and (40, 50). If the input were (20, 20, 30, 50),
then no solution is possible even though the values yield a sum (m = 120) divisible by 3 (m/3 = 40).
